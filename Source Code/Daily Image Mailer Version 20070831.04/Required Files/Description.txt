Daily Image Mailer

Daily Image Mailer is program that sends a random file from a specified folder to specified email addresses using a supplied address of an available SMTP mail server. The file that is selected is sent as an attachment with the email. 

Once a file has been sent, it is removed from the input pool and moved to a sent folder. Once all files in the input folder have been removed, all the items from the sent folder are moved back to the input folder.

There are two scheduling options: The mail is sent out twice a day, at times specified by the user, or A base time is set and an fixed interval in minutes is used to send mails out based on the base time.
